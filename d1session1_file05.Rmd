## Making graphs - the ggplot2 way

The "bread and butter" for making graphs in R is using the ggplot2 package which is part of the tidyverse suite of packages.

The cool part of ggplot2 is that the graphs are created layer by layer.

For example, let's create the plot space for a graph we want to make.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = abalone)
```

Not terribly exciting, but we do have a graphic window defined and ready for what we want to plot.

## Making a histogram

Let's look at the abalones heights and make a histogram. To start we need to specify which variable we will be plotting. We do this using the aes() or aesthetic command.

```{r}
ggplot(data = abalone,
       aes(x=height))
```

Now we got an x-axis label and some grid lines. But nothing is plotted yet. This is because we need to add a geographic object layer. These are called geoms. The geom for making a histogram is ... geom_histogram.

geoms are added using the + command to add layers to the plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data = abalone,
       aes(x=height)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

Again not terribly exciting.

Let spruce this up with some color. We can add our color specifications using color for the lines around each histogram bar (think outline) and fill for the color we want the bars to be.

```{r}
ggplot(data = abalone,
       aes(x=height)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "blue", fill = "green")
```

We can also add a title using ggtitle(). Let's make the title "Distribution of Abalone Heights in mm".

```{r}
ggplot(data = abalone,
       aes(x=height)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "blue", fill = "green") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Abalone Heights in mm")
```

## Adding a density plot on top of the histogram

This gets a little tricky. Histograms are by default set to have the height of the bars equal to the count of the number of observations in each bin. However, density plots are usually set to the proportion of the observations of the total dataset.

To see an example of how to do this - see the [R Graphics Cookbook](http://www.cookbook-r.com/). 

A density plot with histogram can be seen here [http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Plotting_distributions_(ggplot2)/](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Plotting_distributions_(ggplot2)/).

Using this example, we can use it here for abalone heights. I changed the binwidth option to one that is a good binwidth for our dataset.

The secret to this plot is the use of y=..density.. 

See Help/ggplot2 cheatsheet and see more at RStudio [https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).

```{r}
# Histogram overlaid with kernel density curve
ggplot(data = abalone, aes(x=height)) + 
    geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),      
                   binwidth = 0.03,
                   colour="black", fill="white") +
    geom_density(alpha=.2, fill="#FF6666")  
```

## Make clustered boxplots

Boxplots can also be used to get an idea of broad distribution of variables in terms of central density and spread. Let's look at the distribution of the abalone heights by sex.

To do this we need to add another variable to our aes() aesthetic. This time we will make x=sex and y=height.

And we will use geom_boxplot() as our geom.

```{r}
ggplot(data = abalone,
       aes(x=sex, y=height)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

There is another cool way to look at these densities. Try making this plot again but change out geom_boxplot() for geom_violin().

```{r}
ggplot(data = abalone,
       aes(x=sex, y=height)) +
  geom_violin()
```

We can actually combine these by layering the geom's on top of one another to get an interesting plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data = abalone,
       aes(x=sex, y=height)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Your turn

Modify the code above to set the violin plot fill color to "yellow".

```{r}
# insert your code here
ggplot(data = abalone,
       aes(x=sex, y=height)) +
  geom_violin(color = "black", fill = "yellow") +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "green")

```

## Scatterplots

Scatterplots are also made using layers. You need 2 aesthetics for the x and y axes. The main way to make scatterplots is using geom_point().

Let's look at the abalone heights and lengths together. Set x=diameter and y=length.

```{r}
ggplot(data = abalone,
       aes(x=diameter, y=length)) +
  geom_point()
```

There are some possible outliers in this dataset. Remember that length was supposed to be the largest dimension in the dataset. So, length should always be => than diameter. 

We can visualize this by adding a x=y reference line using the geom_abline() layer. Any points that fall above the line will be abalones whose diameters are > than their length which is probably a typo or a place where these 2 measurements got reversed during data entry. We need to add the options for the intercept and slope. See help(geom_abline).

```{r}
ggplot(data = abalone,
       aes(x=diameter, y=length)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(intercept=0, slope=1)
```

## Color by sex

Let's add some color. What if we wanted to look at the points by sex. We can add that as an option to our list of aesthetics in aes().

And let's color the diagonal reference line red.

```{r}
ggplot(data = abalone,
       aes(x=diameter, y=length, color=sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(intercept=0, slope=1, color="red")
```

Notice that "red" is in quotes but sex is not. sex is the name of the variable, but red is a specific color option.

We can move the color=sex aesthetic to the geom_point() layer and get the same plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data = abalone,
       aes(x=diameter, y=length)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=sex)) +
  geom_abline(intercept=0, slope=1, color="red")
```

## Create panels or facets by sex

Another way to look at these data is to create panels or facets by sex using the facet_wrap() layer option. We can keep everything the same as before but just create separate plots by sex.

```{r}
ggplot(data = abalone,
       aes(x=diameter, y=length)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=sex)) +
  geom_abline(intercept=0, slope=1, color="red") +
  facet_wrap(~sex)
```

Which sex has the error where diameter is > length?

## Your turn

Make a scatterplot of the abalone shellWeight on the x-axis and wholeWeight on the y-axis. The abalones whole weight should always be the largest weight. Let's see if we can spot any where shellWeight was > wholeWeight?

Make a scatterplot like one of the ones above, color the points by sex and add an abline to spot if there is a data point with an error and if so which sex it is for.

```{r}
ggplot(data = abalone,
       aes(x=shellWeight, y=wholeWeight)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=sex)) +
  geom_abline(intercept=0, slope=1, color="red") +
  facet_wrap(~sex)
```

## Linear relationships?

It looks like there is a close to linear relationship between several of these measures. Let's look at adding a smoothed fit line to a plot of length (y-axis) by diameter (x-axis).

We can do this by using geom_smooth() instead of the geom_abline(). You can leave out the intercept and slope options. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = abalone,
       aes(x=diameter, y=length)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=sex)) +
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  facet_wrap(~sex)
```

Check out the examples shown in help(geom_smooth). The default for geom_smooth() is the loess localize smoothing method. Let's try setting the method to lm() for linear model which fits a simple linear regression line to the data. Since we have set the aes(color=sex), the lines are fit by each sex separately.

```{r}
ggplot(data = abalone,
       aes(x=diameter, y=length)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=sex)) +
  geom_smooth(color="red", method=lm) +
  facet_wrap(~sex)
```

## Your turn

Create a set of scatterplots by sex and add either a loess or linear fit line for x=shellWeight and y=wholeWeight

```{r}
ggplot(data = abalone,
       aes(x=shellWeight, y=wholeWeight)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=sex)) +
  geom_smooth(color="red", method=lm) +
  facet_wrap(~sex)
```
